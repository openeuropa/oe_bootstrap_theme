# Bootstrap Component Library (BCL) components, provided in OE Bootstrap Theme,
# can be overridden by sub-theme similar components. Such overrides should have
# the same name as the original BCL component and are placed, usually, under
# `assets/bcl` directory, relative to sub-theme root. If the sub-theme needs a
# different location, you'll need to uncomment the following lines, and replace
# `components/templates` with the custom path of BCL components overrides:
# openeuropa:
#    bootstrap_component_library:
#      components_location: components/templates
